- No cancellations recorded on: Tuesday → No flights on Tuesday. In case canellation rates are truly low, avoid overbooking on these days and use standard buffers only.
- Highest cancellation rate: Monday (rate=5.5%) → tighten fare fences and increase overbooking buffers on this weekday.
- Median days after booking to cancel ≈ 3, P90 ≈ 4 → design refund rules & retention nudges within these windows.
- Median days before flight to cancel ≈ 26, P90 ≈ 50 → calibrate overbooking and release of low fares accordingly.
- Channel with highest cancel rate: travel agency (≈ 5.6%) → steer demand to direct channels or adjust partner SLAs.
- Lowest average LF: Monday (≈ 70.0%); Highest: Thursday (≈ 75.0%) → re-time or stimulate low days; protect yield on high days.
- Time-of-day LF: weakest=Afternoon (≈ 72.1%), strongest=Morning (≈ 73.7%) → bank timing & pricing by day-part.
- Rev/Pax vs LF correlation ≈ -0.07 → filling extra seats may dilute yield; prioritize yield protection at higher LF.
- Largest directional imbalance: FCO→FRA vs reverse (ΔLF≈ 4.9%) → asymmetric pricing or gauge.
- Ancillary share: low on FCO→PMO (≈ 9.2%), high on FRA→FCO (≈ 10.2%) → target bundles where low.
